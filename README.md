# Tucker-s-Lemma-Applications
Paper that I wrote for the course Topological Methods in Combinatorics and Game Theory, part of my Master's Degree.

In this work I present a constructive proof of Fan’s weak generalization, which will be used to form a constructive proof of Tucker's Lemma (so that an algorithm can be induced).

Furthermore I present some applications of Tucker's Lemma, such as the Ham Sandwich Theorem and the Necklace Partition Problem.
